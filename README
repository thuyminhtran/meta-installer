meat-installer
============
The installation program is anaconda installer which
ported from fedora 26.
(https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Anaconda)

This layer provides a target-based installer for Yocto.
It requires most of the layers that Yocto provides.

There are two builds required, one is target build,
another is host build.

The image/packages of target build is installed on the target hard
disk as user requirements.

The image of host build is to run a installer program (anaconda)
and install image/packages of target build to hard disk.

Dependencies
------------
This layer depends on the Yocto of bitbake, oe-core,
meta-filesystems, meta-gnome, meta-python, meta-oe
meta-networking, and meta-initramfs layer.

Limitation
-----------
1) Since OE use grub-efi to generate live image, the compatible host
   is i.86|x86_64
   (Set MACHINE = "qemux86-64|qemux86" in default build)

2) The target installer based on fedora 26, so it requires:
   - systemd as init manager
   - python3
   - dnf2/rpm4 pakcage management
   - gobject-introspection which requires qemu-usermode
     in MACHINE_FEATURES

Building the target installer
-----------
1. Summary
   The target installer is enabled by including this layer.
   There are two images in target installer, one is target
   image which to be installed to target, another is installer image
   which to do the installation.

   A target image requires specific components to be compatible with
   the installer. To install these components set
   DISTRO_FEATURES_append = " installer-support in local.conf

   For installer image, you are not supposed to change the 'DISTRO'
   setting in target build directory. It may work, but it's not
   recommended. Instead we should recommend the user run a
   oe-init-build-env and create a new build directory for the installer.
   Set DISTRO = 'installer' in local.conf file.

   There are two kinds of installer builds: "Image Based Install" and
   "Package Based Install". The former is to install a prebuilt image,
   the latter is to install RPM packages.

   For Image Based Install, set INSTALLER_TARGET_BUILD =
   '<target-build-image>' in local.conf to specify an .ext2, .ext3,
   or ext4 image file, then the installer will copy this image to the
   target.

   For Package Based Install,  set INSTALLER_TARGET_BUILD =
   '<target-build-topdir>' to specify the path to target build directory
   that will supply RPMs, and INSTALLER_TARGET_IMAGE = '<target-image-pn>'
   to specify the image recipe name, then the installer will install its
   RPMs to the target;

2. Two main use cases
   2.1 Installer image with ext2, ext3 or ext4 image from the target
       build to be copied to local disk.

   2.2 Installer image with RPMs from the target build to be installed
       to local disk.

   Note: Each option requires two builds, one is for the target build,
         the other one is for the installer itself. The build and installer
         board (BSP) configuration should be the same.

3. Examples for the use cases
   The following example is to install a target image core-image-minimal
   by host image core-image-install.

   3.1 Image Based Install
       3.1.1 Clone away

           $ mkdir <installer-project>
           $ cd <installer-project>
           $ git clone git://git.openembedded.org/meta-openembedded
           $ git clone git://git.openembedded.org/openembedded-core oe-core
           $ cd oe-core
           $ git clone git://git.openembedded.org/bitbake

       3.1.2 Prepare target build

           $ . <installer-project>/oe-core/oe-init-build-env <target_build>

           The build requires 'installer-support' in DISTRO_FEATURES to
           help installation. It also requires RPM packages and systemd
           init manager. Edit conf/local.conf to use:
           $ echo 'DISTRO_FEATURES_append = " installer-support"' >> conf/local.conf
           $ echo 'PACKAGE_CLASSES = "package_rpm"' >> conf/local.conf
           $ echo 'VIRTUAL-RUNTIME_init_manager = "systemd"' >> conf/local.conf
           $ echo 'DISTRO_FEATURES_append = " systemd"' >> conf/local.conf

           Edit conf/bblayers.conf to include other layers
           BBLAYERS ?= " \

               <installer-project>/meta-installer \
           "

       3.1.3 Build target image in <target_build>.

           $ bitbake core-image-minimal

       3.1.4 Prepare installer build.
           $ . <installer-project>/oe-core/oe-init-build-env <installer_build>

           The build requires DISTRO = "installer", location of target image.
           Edit conf/local.conf to use:
           $ echo 'PACKAGE_CLASSES = "package_rpm"' >> conf/local.conf
           $ echo 'DISTRO = "installer"' >> conf/local.conf
           $ echo 'INSTALLER_TARGET_BUILD = "<target_build>/tmp-glibc/deploy/images/qemux86/core-image-minimal-qemux86.ext4"' >> conf/local.conf

           Edit conf/bblayers.conf to include other layers

           "

       3.1.5 Build installer image in installer_build.

           $ bitbake core-image-installer

   3.2 Package Based Install
       3.2.1 Clone away
             The same with 3.1.1

       3.2.2 Prepare target build
             The same with 3.1.2

       3.2.3 Build target image in <target_build>.
             The same with 3.1.3

       3.2.4 Prepare installer build.
           $ . <installer-project>/oe-core/oe-init-build-env <installer_build>

           The build requires DISTRO = "installer", location of target build
           and recipe name of target image.
           Edit conf/local.conf to use:
           $ echo 'PACKAGE_CLASSES = "package_rpm"' >> conf/local.conf
           $ echo 'DISTRO = "installer"' >> conf/local.conf

           "

       3.2.4 Build installer image in installer_build.
             The same with 3.1.4

4. Install
   4.1 Burn the output ISO to a DVD or dd it to a USB disk, and use it to
       boot the target board and start the install.

   4.2 Use qemu for testing
       Build target installer with machine of qemux86

       Create the qemu disk:
       $ <installer_build>/tmp-glibc/sysroots-components/x86_64/qemu-native/usr/bin/qemu-img create -f qcow hd0.vdisk 5000M

       Start qemu with installer image:
       $ runqemu qemux86 core-image-installer iso slirp kvm qemuparams="-drive file=hd0.vdisk,if=virtio,format=qcow"

       Add "-vnc :4" to qemuparams to start a VNC capable session.
       Add "-m 1024" to qemuparams to allocate enough memory.

       Start qemu with installed target:
       $ runqemu qemux86 core-image-installer iso slirp kvm qemuparams="-drive file=hd0.vdisk,if=virtio,format=qcow -boot menu=on"

       Run vncviewer to connect VNC capable session.
       $ vncviewer <host-ip-address>:4

       Add "-boot menu=on" to qemuparams and run vncviewer to connect,
       press ESC key, manually choose "2. Virtio disk" "to boot from hard disk.

   4.3 Use virtualbox for testing
       4.3.1 Prepare virtualbox
             Take Ubuntu 16.04 for example, the virtualbox is 5.0.40
             sudo apt-get install virtualbox

       4.3.2 Create virtual machine
             'New'-> Name:***
                     Type:Linux
                     Version:Linux 2.6/3.x/4.x(32 bit)
                     Memory size: 1024MB
                     Hard disk: Create a virtual hard disk now
             'Create'-> VDI(Virtualbox Disk Image)

       4.3.3 Add ISO storage to virtual machine
             Select newly created virtual machine
             'Setting'-> 'Storage'-> 'Controller:SATA'->
             'Adds optical drive' -> 'Choose disk' ->
             'core-image-installer-qemux86.iso'

             Remove IDE Empty optical
             'Setting'-> 'Storage'-> 'Controller:IDE'->
             'Empyt' -> Removes selected storage attachment

       4.3.4 Config net for virtual machine
             Select newly created virtual machine
             'Setting'-> 'Network'-> 'Enable Network Adapter'->
             'Attached to: Bridged Adapter'-> 'Name: eno1'

       4.3.5 Add serial port to virtual machine
             Select newly created virtual machine
             'Setting'-> 'Serial Ports'-> 'Port 1'->
             'Enable Serial Port'-> Port Number: COM1
                                    Port Mode: Host Pipe
                                    Unselect 'Connect to existing pipe/socket'
                                    Path/Address: /tmp/pipe

       4.3.6 Use minicom to connect virtual machine's serial port
             sudo minicom -s
             'Serial port setup'->
             'A -    Serial Device      : unix#/tmp/pipe'->
             'Exit'

       4.3.7 Start virtual machine
             Select newly created virtual machine-> 'Start'

             After the installation finished, delete ISO storage and
             start virtual machine again to check the installed target.

   4.4 Need 1G memory size at least
       While starting qemu/virtualbox/vmware for testing, please make
       sure virtual machine has 1G memory at least.

5. Use custom installer.conf
   The second build can use installer.conf to help speed up the build
   process when package based installs, the user can set WRL_INSTALLER_CONF
   in the conf file, for example:

   edit local.conf
   WRL_INSTALLER_CONF = "/my/installer.conf"

   You can customize the contents of installer.conf when needed, for example,
   add packages that you will like to install, but if you do, you must ensure
   that the added packages are in the target build (target_build).

   To do this, use the file /.buildstamp after the installation and edit it
   for later installs.

6. Perform the kickstart installation
   The installer can support kickstart installs. To do this, use the ks file
   from /root/anaconda-ks.cfg after the installation and edit it for later
   installs. You can specify the ks file by setting KICKSTART_FILE in the conf
   file, for example:

   KICKSTART_FILE = "/my/anaconda-ks.cfg"

   Then the second build will take it and start the kickstart installs
   by default when you start the target with installer image.

7. About Grub version
   The current installer only supports grub 2.

8. How to create RPM metadata in build
   bitbake package-index

   There is a repodata in deploy dir:
   $ find tmp-glibc/deploy/rpm/ -name repodata
   tmp-glibc/deploy/rpm/repodata

9. Put multiple target builds into one installer image
   9.1 Create and build multiple target build projects.
       Refer to section 3.1.1 on how to setup and build each target project.
       In this example, the projects are named target_build1, target_build2 and
       target_build3. The target_build1 and target_build2 are build dirs,
       target_build3 is ext4 file. Build 'core-image-sato' in
       target_build1 and build 'core-image-minimal' in target_build2.

   9.2 Edit local.conf, use variable INSTALLER_TARGET_BUILD to point to
       "<target_build1> <target_build2> <target_build3>", and set
       INSTALLER_TARGET_IMAGE = "core-image-sato core-image-minimal",
       the space is the separator:

       $ bitbake core-image-installer

       Then the installer image will contain all target builds specified,
       including target_build1, target_build2 and target_build3.

       When you boot the installer image, you will get a selection menu:
       NOTE: target_buildX is the basename of project

       =============== Found the following products ===============
       1) DISTRO1    target_build1    DISTRO_NAME1    DISTRO_VERION1
       2) DISTRO2    target_build2    DISTRO_NAME2    DISTRO_VERION2
       3) <target_build3-ext4-file>-3

       Please enter your choice (0 to quit):

       NOTE: You need to use a proper name for the target build project
             since its basename will be used in the selection menus.

       NOTE: The number of the entries in WRL_INSTALLER_CONF or
             KICKSTART_FILE must be the same as the number of target build
             projects.
             For example, if you want to use WRL_INSTALLER_CONF or
             KICKSTART_FILE for target_build1, target_build2 and
             target_build3, set each of the three in the conf file.

             WRL_INSTALLER_CONF = "/my/target1.conf /my/target2.conf \
                                    /my/target3.conf"
             KICKSTART_FILE = "/my/target1.ks /my/target2.ks \
                               /my/target3.ks"

             Then target_build1 will use /my/target1.conf and /my/target1.ks,
             target_build2 and target_build3 will work similarly.
